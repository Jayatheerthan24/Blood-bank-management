# Blood-bank-management
Description

Managing blood donations and requests manually often leads to errors, delays, and difficulty in tracking available blood units. The Blood Bank Management System aims to automate donor registration, blood storage, and patient requests, ensuring timely availability of safe blood and reducing mismanagement. 

# OOP Concepts Used

Class & Object – Entities like Donor, Patient, BloodBank, Request modeled as objects.

Encapsulation – Data (attributes) and methods are bundled inside classes.

Abstraction – Internal logic (e.g., storing blood, issuing blood) hidden behind methods.

Inheritance – Common attributes can be reused using a base Person class.

Polymorphism – Same method works differently (e.g., overloaded issueBlood()).

Association/Aggregation – Relationships between Donor, Patient, BloodBank, and BloodUnit.
